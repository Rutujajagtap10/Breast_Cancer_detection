# What is breast cancer? 
Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled, chaotic way. The cells keep on proliferating, producing copies that get progressively more abnormal. In most cases, the cell copies eventually end up forming a tumor.

Breast cancer occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumor originates in the breast. As breast cancer tumors mature, they may metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. The primary route of metastasis is the lymphatic system which, ironically enough, is also the body's primary system for producing and transporting white blood cells and other cancer-fighting immune system cells throughout the body. Metastasized cancer cells that aren't destroyed by the lymphatic system's white blood cells move through the lymphatic vessels and settle in remote body locations, forming new tumors and perpetuating the disease process.

Breast cancer is not just a woman's disease. It is quite possible for men to get breast cancer, although it occurs less frequently in men than in women. Our discussion will focus primarily on breast cancer as it relates to women but it should be noted that much of the information is also applicable for men.

# Role of Artificial Intelligence in Breast-Cancer detection :- 

A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. It can be used to check for breast cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It can also be used if you have a lump or other sign of breast cancer.

Screening mammography is the type of mammogram that checks you when you have no symptoms. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 70. But it can also have drawbacks. Mammograms can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation. You should talk to your doctor about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together, you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram.

Now while its difficult to figure out for physicians by seeing only images of x-ray that weather the tumor is toxic or not training a artificial intelligence algorithms according to the identification of tumour can be of great help.

# Project Description :-

â€¢	Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. Breast cancer occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumour originates in the breast. As breast cancer tumours mature, they may metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. Now while its difficult to figure out for physicians by seeing only images of x-ray that weather the tumour is toxic or not training a artificial intelligence algorithms according to the identification of tumour can be of great help. The data set is a Computer Features dataset that is publicly available for research purpose https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data This dataset contains 32 features of  Attributes . Number of instances: 569  Number of attributes: 32 (ID, diagnosis, 30 real-valued input features)Attribute information1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness,  concavity, concave point, symmetry ,fractal dimension and  the output is predicting field 2, diagnosis: B = benign, M = malignant. best predictive accuracy obtained using one separating plane in the 3-D space of Worst Area, Worst Smoothness and Mean Texture. Estimated accuracy 97.5% using repeated 10-fold cross validations. Classifier has correctly diagnosed 176 consecutive new patients as of November

# Result :-

- predicting field 2, diagnosis: B = benign, M = malignant
- sets are linearly separable using all 30 input features
- best predictive accuracy obtained using one separating plane
    in the 3-D space of Worst Area, Worst Smoothness and
    Mean Texture.  Estimated accuracy 97.5% using repeated
    10-fold crossvalidations.  Classifier has correctly
    diagnosed 176 consecutive new patients as of November

# Conclusion :- 

With these project classifier techniques are applied to Breast-cancer dataset and results are compared. Three classifier techniques with highest accuracy scores are chosen as final execution with their accuracy, cross-validation score and execution time is specified.
